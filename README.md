This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Decentralized Chat App using Blockchain and AI
This repository contains the code for a decentralized chat application that utilizes blockchain technology and artificial intelligence for messaging. The application is built using the Solidity programming language for smart contract development and the Metamask wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

Features
Decentralized Messaging: The chat application leverages the Ethereum blockchain to provide a decentralized messaging platform. Messages are stored securely and immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and data integrity.

Smart Contract: The core functionality of the chat app is implemented as a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract handles message storage, retrieval, and communication between users. It enforces security and provides a trustless environment for communication.

Metamask Integration: The Metamask wallet is used as a means of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to sign transactions and access their accounts securely. Metamask simplifies the process of sending and receiving messages within the chat application.

AI-powered Messaging: The chat app incorporates artificial intelligence algorithms to enhance messaging capabilities. AI algorithms can be used for message filtering, sentiment analysis, and automatic categorization of messages.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-chat-app.git
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Configure Metamask:

Install the Metamask browser extension in your preferred browser.
Create a new Ethereum account or import an existing one.
Connect Metamask to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, etc.).
Ensure you have a sufficient balance of Ether (ETH) for interacting with the chat application.
Deploy the smart contract:

Compile the Solidity smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Ethereum network using the deployment script.
Start the application:

sql
Copy code
npm start
The chat application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Connect your Metamask wallet to the chat application by logging in with your Metamask account.

Start sending and receiving messages with other participants on the Ethereum network.

Utilize the AI-powered features by enabling the corresponding options within the chat application. AI algorithms will process messages and provide additional functionality based on the implemented features.

Contributing
Contributions to this decentralized chat app are welcome. If you have any ideas, improvements, or bug fixes, please submit a pull request. Ensure that your contributions adhere to the established coding conventions and best practices.
